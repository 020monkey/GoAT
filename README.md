## NOTE:
#### Compilation
Compile with  ```go build -o GoAT.exe -ldflags "-H windowsgui" "C:\GoAT.go"```	to have no console show.


#### Under development
While I keep teaching myself Go, I will be updating this project. If at anytime someone would like to add to the project they can. Just post in the 'issues' section and I will add your code and credits to the main project.
